<b>Please at least make a sincere attempt to Read &amp; Comprehend<br>
the propositions being presented in the Above Web-Linked Document<br> 
before you contact your Local Community Organizers with questions or comments.
<br/> <br/>
<u>The larger Reason Why</u> most of us believe that <u>this effort is Extremely Important</u><br>
is explained in an accompanying web-page &amp; document, here:<br/>

A very rough-draft of an incomplete document which generally out-lines<br/>
the <u>Powerful Legal Tools </u><u>of a Commercial Nature</u>,<br/>
&amp; which are Lawfully Available to the Elected Leaders of our new &amp; Responsibly Self-Governing Local Communities,</b></font><br>
&amp; <u>through </u><u>which </u><u>we intend to promptly start producing “Economic Prosperity</u>”<br/>
for All Socially-Responsible Members of these Local Communities, is described in the web-link here:<br/>
<a href="https://ConstitutionalGov.us/SupremeCourtOfLaw/Treason-USA/5-EconomicPolicy&amp;Incentives-ForBuilding-CommonLawCommunities-TreasonRemedySupplement-V1.2.pdf"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">
https://ConstitutionalGov.us/SupremeCourtOfLaw/Treason-USA/5-EconomicPolicy&amp;Incentives-ForBuilding-CommonLawCommunities-TreasonRemedySupplement-V1.2.pdf</font></a>
<br/><br/>
All of the above linked documents are available under the general directory here:<br/>
<a href="https://ConstitutionalGov.us/SupremeCourtOfLaw/Treason-USA/"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">
https://ConstitutionalGov.us/SupremeCourtOfLaw/Treason-USA/</font></a>
<br/><br/>
We expect soon to get the “Economic Prosperity” document updated to a more respectable presentation; <br>
&amp; all of these documents, along with their supportive citations documents, <br>
&amp; all newly updated versions of all of these documents,<br>
should be soon available under the last general web-linked directory above.
<br/><br>
Once you have at least made a sincere effort at reading &amp; comprehending the first web-linked document above,<br>
&amp; if you are now sufficiently confident in this effort to commit<br>
reasonable amounts of your precious time &amp; energy resources to<br>
this powerful local community building &amp; empowerment project;<br>
then, please go directly to the main web-page directory, here:<br/>
<a href="https://ConstitutionalGov.us/Organizing-Townships&amp;Precincts/OathOfOfficeForms/"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">
https://ConstitutionalGov.us/Organizing-Townships&amp;Precincts/OathOfOfficeForms/</font></a>
<br><br>
Here-under; <u>the first, most basic, &amp; entry-level document</u> which you will need to read, comprehend, fill-out, &amp; sign;<br>
is our “<u>Oath of Office for Qualified Elector</u>”; which is available, here:<br/>
<a href="https://ConstitutionalGov.us/Organizing-Townships&amp;Precincts/OathOfOfficeForms/OathOfOffice1-QualifiedElectors-V4.pdf"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">

<br/><br/>
As you can see under the parent directory, this document is also available in a form which can be easily edited,<br>
in order to make minor changes which might be more comfortable with your own religious, spiritual, or philosophical preferences;<br>
&amp; which the other Electors in your Township Community will likely find both Reasonable &amp; Acceptable. 
<br><br>
If you might be of an even more courageous spirit,<br>
&amp; sufficiently aware of the evils described in the second above-linked “Notice of Treason” document,<br/>
so that the well-informed Qualified Electors in your Township Community<br>
can reasonably feel confident that you will not cower at the first potential for danger;<br/>
then, you might next consider signing also <u>the second of the three above-linked documents</u>,<br/>
which is our “<u>Oath of Office for Town Constable</u>”,<br>
which is our <u>ground-floor &amp; entry-level “Peace Officer” document</u>; &amp; which is available here:<br>

If you might be of an even more courageous spirit,<br>
&amp; sufficiently aware of the evils described in the second above-linked “Notice of Treason” document,<br/>
&amp; sufficiently intelligent to comprehend the essential-elements of<br>
American Constitutional “Due Process of Law”, aka Texas &amp; Oregon Constitutional “Due Course of Law”;<br/>
&amp; there-under to <u>provide the Town Constables of your Precinct with a Reasonable Feeling of Confidence<br>
that You can Defend Their Legitimate Use of Lawful Force in ‘Keeping the Peace</u>’;<br/>
then, you might next consider signing also <u>the third &amp; most powerful of the three above-linked documents</u>,<br>
which is <u>our “Oath of Office for Justice of the Peace</u>”;<br>
&amp; which, so long as you Scrupulously Conform with Constitutional Due-Process-of-Law,<br/>
will give you Legitimate Authority to take your Hundred-Man/Posse-Comitatus Army, Any-Where,<br>
&amp; Arrest Any-One, Absolutely.  ...  That document is similarly available, here:<br></font>
