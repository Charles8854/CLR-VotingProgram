    History in a Pecan Shell

Originally named *Pleasant Valley*, the name was first rejected by
postal authorities since it was already taken. When the application was
resubmitted it bore the name of postmaster William Burkett. The year was
1886 and the "settlers" were mostly cowboys of the McClennan ranch, who
established a community around H. Sackett's store.

By 1940 the town had a thriving population of 200 along with five
businesses. The high school consolidated in 1957 with the Coleman
<http://www.texasescapes.com/TOWNS/Coleman/coleman.htm> and Cross Plains
<http://www.texasescapes.com/TexasPanhandleTowns/CrossPlainsTexas/CrossPlainsTx.htm>
ISDs and the population declined accordingly. By the 1980s Burkett still
had their post office, a community center, a gas station, and cemetery.

/Photographer's Note:/*
*Burkett is interesting. The old bridge should be closed. Even two
pickups would brush mirrors on it. Interesting how many old bridges have
pilings of even older bridges still in place. - /Barclay Gibson/
